# OPCODE Open Spring Fest Guidelines

Welcome to OPCODE, the Open Spring fest where innovation meets collaboration! Below are the guidelines for participants to ensure a productive and ethical experience:

1. **Duration:**

   - The fest will run for 30 days, from March 15th to April 15th.

2. **Code of Conduct and Work Ethics:**

   - Respectful and inclusive interactions are expected from all participants.
   - Maintain professionalism and integrity in all contributions.
   - Discriminatory behavior, harassment, and plagiarism will not be tolerated.

3. **Contribution Guidelines:**

   - To contribute, follow the instructions outlined in the `Contribution.md` file within the respective project repository.

4. **Timing for Issue and PR:**

   - All issues and pull requests should be raised between 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM.

5. **Response Time:**

   - Project maintainers or managers should respond to issues and pull requests within 2 hours of their creation.

6. **Difficulty Levels and Scoring:**

   - Each project will be divided into three difficulty levels: easy, medium, and hard, designated with points 1, 2, and 3 respectively.
   - Issues within each difficulty level will be further categorized as easy (1 point), medium (3 points), and hard (5 points).
   - For example:
     - Participant A successfully completes an easy issue (1 point) from the medium difficulty level (2 points), earning a total of 2 points.
     - Participant B tackles a hard issue (5 points) from the hard difficulty level (3 points), earning a total of 15 points.
     - Participant C resolves a medium issue (3 points) from the easy difficulty level (1 point), earning a total of 3 points.
   - The score earned for each successful pull request will be calculated as the multiplication of the tag point and category point.
   - Participants' total scores will be the sum of scores earned from all their pull requests.

7. **Challenge Completion:**

   - If a participant completes only easy tag problems, their earned score will be adjusted according to a well-designed algorithm to encourage tackling more challenging tasks.

8. **Rejection of Bad PR:**

   - All bad pull requests will be rejected by project maintainers.

9. **Issue Assignment:**

   - If an issue is assigned to a participant, they must complete it within the given time period as specified by the maintainer.
   - Participants can request the maintainer or project manager to assign them an issue. Only then can they work on that issue.
   - If a participant couldn't solve the issue within the given time period, it will be assigned to another participant.

10. **Leaderboard:**

    - A real-time leaderboard will be maintained throughout the fest, displaying participants' scores.

11. **Contact Information:**

    - For any queries regarding the project, participants should reach out to the project manager or maintainer.

12. **Discord Community:**
    - All participants are required to join the Discord community, where they will receive detailed information and have dedicated channels for discussions.

These guidelines aim to ensure a fair, transparent, and enriching experience for all participants in the OPCODE Open Spring fest. Let the collaboration begin!
